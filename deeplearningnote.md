# Applied Math and Machine Learning Basics
## 2 Linear Algebra
### 2.1 Scalars, Vectors, Matrices and Tensors
* scalar: a single number
* vector: an array of numbers
* matrix: 2-D array of numbers
* tensor: an array of numbers arranged on a regular grid with a
variable number of axes is known as a tensor

matrix transpose:  ![](mat_transp.png)
broadcasting: C = A + b, where A, C are matrces and b is a vector. b is add to
each row of A.
